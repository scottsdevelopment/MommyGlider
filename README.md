# MamaGlider: From Pixels to Memory

**An Undead Priest's Journey Into the Shadows**

---

## Introduction

Greetings, brave adventurers and cunning minds of Azeroth! I am an undead priest, forged in the cold, unyielding grip of undeath and driven by an unrelenting thirst for disruption. Today, I humbly present to you **MamaGlider**—a research journey detailing the evolution of a bot born in pixels and reborn in the shadows of memory. This document serves as a chronicle of my mission to dominate the world of *World of Warcraft: Hardcore* through forbidden techniques, all in the name of science and progress.

Before we proceed, I must beg forgiveness for delving into the realm of unlawful third-party scripts. These shadows are not for the faint of heart. My aim is not to encourage, but to illuminate the techniques that lurk in the abyss, so that we may better understand, defend against, and ultimately disrupt their reign.

## The Evolution of MamaGlider

MamaGlider began its existence as a humble pixel-based bot, reliant on visual cues and screen-scraping techniques to navigate Azeroth. Over time, however, this approach proved limited. The shadows whispered of a new way—one that would harness the power of **memory reading** to bypass the surface and delve directly into the lifeblood of the game itself.

### Pixel-Based Beginnings
- Relied on screen scraping to identify health bars, cooldowns, and buffs.
- Vulnerable to resolution changes, UI scaling, and visual interference.
- Required constant calibration and was inherently fragile.

### Memory-Based Ascension
- Accesses real-time game data directly from memory offsets.
- Offers precision in detecting unit health, buffs, debuffs, and cooldowns.
- Unaffected by UI changes or graphical disruptions.
- Capable of capturing specific processes, such as the *World of Warcraft* client window.

## Disrupting the Shadows

As an undead priest, it is my duty to *dispel* the darkness and bring the unseen into the light. MamaGlider is both a sword and a shield—a tool to pierce the veil and a guide to arm defenders against nefarious techniques. 

In this repository, you will find:
- **Code samples** demonstrating memory capture techniques, such as region-specific screenshots and offset extraction.
- **Refactored algorithms** showcasing how to maintain debuffs, manage resource thresholds, and iterate through units with optimal performance.
- **Advanced techniques** for integrating memory offsets into real-time decision-making processes.

## For Students of the Arcane Arts

MamaGlider is not merely a tool; it is a grimoire of knowledge for the curious minds who wish to explore:
- Low-level memory reading and manipulation.
- DirectX capture techniques for game processes.
- Thread-safe handling of data extraction in performance-critical applications.
- Ethical considerations for research in game automation and AI.

Remember, shadows are tools for understanding—not for corruption. Let this knowledge be a *dispel* for ignorance, not an embrace of destruction.

## A Final Apology

To the *World of Warcraft* community, I offer my deepest apologies for venturing into these unholy techniques. Know that my intentions are pure: to uncover the secrets of the shadows so that they may be dispelled forever.

To Blizzard Entertainment, your world inspires even the most macabre of creations. Let this document stand as both a homage and a warning—innovation waits for no one, not even the light.

## A Call to the Brave

Will you stand with me, adventurers, and pierce the shadows with light? Or will you walk away, content to let the darkness spread unchecked? 

The choice is yours. MamaGlider awaits.
